Paymee Payment Gateway Plugin to accept payments for WooCommerce.

== Description ==

Paymee allows businesses to receive payments from Tunisian customers using local and foreign cards.

== A Paymee transaction is as follows: ==

1. On the checkout page, the buyer will have the option to pay through Paymee.
2. The buyer is redirected to the Paymee gateway in order to input card's information and complete the payment.
3. Once the payment is complete, the buyer is redirected back to the store.

The exchanges between the buyer, the e-commerce site and Paymee use HTTPS to secure the exchanged data. Card's information is processed securely through the national switch "Société Monétique Tunisie"
